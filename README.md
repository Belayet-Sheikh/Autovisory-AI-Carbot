## üöÄ Live Demo & Project Structure

**This project is presented in two parts to showcase both a live, interactive application and the underlying large-scale data analysis.**

### 1. The Live Interactive Demo

This is the public-facing application that you can test right now. It demonstrates the full functionality of the AI chatbot.

**[‚û°Ô∏è View the Live Demo Here!](https://autovisory-demo-app.streamlit.app/)**

**Important Note:** The live demo runs on a **lightweight, sampled version** of the full 2.5 GB dataset. This was a deliberate design choice to ensure a fast, responsive user experience on a free web server, which would not be possible with the full dataset.

### 2. The Main Repository & Full Analysis

The complete data analysis, data cleaning notebooks, and original project files are located in our main repository. This is where you can see the proof of work on the full-scale dataset.
